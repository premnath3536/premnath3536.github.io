        <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br>
        <h2>Association of Computer Technologists was started as an instigator of awareness in the field of Computer Science in the year 2010. It is run by passionate students and prominent faculty members of the department of Computer Technology, Anna University, MIT campus. The department is headed by Dr. P. Jayashree, who herself is a researcher and innovator.On top of this ACT serves as a platform for the admirers of technology to share their knowledge which has sparked many fruitful discussions. Many of these ideas have come into reality in the form of real time projects by the students. The students' areas of interest range from web development to blockchain. We take immense pleasure and pride in hosting this year's Prayatna event, which is to be conducted on March 23rd & 24th 2024. Prayatna serves as the culmination of masterful minds and the ideas those minds portray. Over 5000 students from 150 colleges rally together for this festival of Computer Technology. Prayatna establishes a platform for these students to showcase their swaggering talents in the fast- growing field of Computer Science.</h2>
